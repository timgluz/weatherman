# A REST-based weather serviceThe goal of your case is to develop a small REST based service to retrieve information about the weather in different cities. The service should be powered by node.js and utilize the data from openweathermap.org. The list of available cities can be found here http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.json.gz.Besides the requirement to use node.js, you are free to use any library or tool you need to develop the service.

Please dockerify the service and add a little test-suite for checking if the service works as expected.

Please use git for tracking your progress. For handing the case in, please share a link to a public git repo or use git-bundle (https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/03/10/bundles.html) and share the file with me.

## Usage

#### development

```bash
# pull NPM dependencies
npm install

# create geoIndex and initialize datastorage:
cd scripts && node create_index.js

# update configs for development
vim config/development.json
	
# ready to start server
npm start
```

#### Dockerized version

```

# pull NPM dependencies
npm install

# create geoIndex and initialize datastorage:
cd scripts && node create_index.js

# update configs for development
vim config/development.json
	
# build docker image
docker build -t timgluz/weatherman .

# running dockerized app
# ps: don't forget to update development.json config
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v $(PWD)/config:/usr/src/app/config timgluz/weatherman

```

#### testing

```
# pull NPM dependencies
npm install

# create geoIndex and initialize datastorage:
cd scripts && node create_index.js

# update configs for development
vim config/test.json

# run tests
npm test
```


## RoutesThe following routes should be provided by the service. All the routes should deliver the response as json and indicate the response type with the proper content type.### `GET /cities?lat={latitude}&lng={longitude}`List the available cities around the specified latitude/longitude within a radius of 10 kilometers Example: http://localhost:8080/cities?lat=49.48&lng=8.46Returns:
* `HTTP 200 Ok` with body:
```js[  {"id":2873891,"name":"Mannheim"}, {"id":6555232,"name":"Altrip"}, ...]
```* `HTTP 400 Bad Request` if parameters are missing:
```js
{
  "code":"BadRequestError",
  "message":"lat/lng required"
}```### `GET /cities/{city_id}`Retrieve the details for a city (by city_id) Example: http://localhost:8080/cities/2873891Returns:
* `HTTP 200 Ok` with body:
```js{  "id":2873891,  "name":"Mannheim", "lat":49.488331, "lng":8.46472}
```* `HTTP 404 Not Found` if the city_id was not found:
```js
{  "code":"NotFoundError",  "message":"not found"
}
```

### `GET /cities/{city_id}/weather`Retrieve the weather data for a city (by city_id) Example: http://localhost:8080/cities/2873891/weatherReturns:

* `HTTP 200 Ok` with body:
```js
{  "type": "Clear",
  "type_description": "clear sky",
  "sunrise": "2016-08-23T08:00:00.000Z",
  "sunset": "2016-08-23T22:00:00.000Z",
  "temp": 29.72,  "temp_min": 26.67,  "temp_max": 35,  "pressure": 1026,  "humidity": 36,  "clouds_percent": 0,  "wind_speed": 1.5}
```
* `HTTP 404 Not Found` if the city_id was not found:
```js
{  "code":"NotFoundError",  "message":"not found"
}
```### Getting startedThe following libraries and tools could be helpful to implement the service:* restify (http://restify.com/) ­ as the baseline to implement the REST web service* request (https://github.com/request/request) ­ to make requests to the http://openweathermap.org/ API
* postman (https://www.getpostman.com/) or curl to test the service
